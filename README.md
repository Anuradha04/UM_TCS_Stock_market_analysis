# Stock Market Prediction Using Machine Learning
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) stock prices using machine learning techniques. The goal is to uncover trends, assess volatility, and improve forecasting accuracy with models like Linear Regression, XGBoost, and Prophet.

## Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering (lag features, moving averages, RSI, MACD).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Correlation analysis, trend visualization, volatility assessment.

Model Development:

Linear Regression (R² = 1.00, potential overfitting)

XGBoost (R² = 0.83, better generalization)

Prophet (R² = 0.98, high MAE but good for trends)

Performance Comparison: MSE, MAE, and R² metrics evaluated.
